# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

Some of the Exploratory Data Analysis projects I have developed, using Kaggle Datasets:

- EDA on "SuperStore" Sales (`eda-superstore-project.ipynb`): Exploratory Data Analysis on the Sales of a 4 year period. It includes Sales & Profit analysis with Series Plots, Scatterplots, Barplots regarding the product's characteristics, Geo Analysis and RFM Customer Segementation.
